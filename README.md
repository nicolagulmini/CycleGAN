# CycleGAN

Following the tutorial at https://machinelearningmastery.com/how-to-develop-cyclegan-models-from-scratch-with-keras/ this is an attempt to implement a CycleGAN (original paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.10593.pdf) model to perform human hand drawn sketches of animals - pokèmon artworks translation. 
The sketches belong to the dataset at this link http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/projects/classifysketch/ while the pokémon artworks belong to this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/abcsds/pokemon.
